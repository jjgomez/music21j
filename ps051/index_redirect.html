<h1>Backup Server...</h1>

<p>
Due to ongoing problems with connectivity to the music department this weekend, I have set up a backup server at:
<a style='font-size: 22pt' href="http://scripts.mit.edu/~cuthbert/music21j/ps051/">http://scripts.mit.edu/~cuthbert/music21j/ps051/</a>. Click to go there.</p>

<p>Please complete your PS 5 there this week.  You will need to <b>reauthorize your Jazz-Soft/Xkey</b> plugin by unblocking it 
(there will probably be a broken puzzle piece in your address bar on the far right if you are using Chrome) and probably
restart your web browser before doing the MIDI section.  You will also need to log in again with your username and password. 
Please contact the Piazza forum if there are problems.</p>

<p>
I will determine soon whether that site will provide more stability and whether you should update your bookmarks.  Thank you.
