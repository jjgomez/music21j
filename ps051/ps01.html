<p>
When working with multiple parts that are to be played simultaneously, it is very important
to ensure that all of the notes that will be played at the same time are vertically aligned,
along with clefs, time signatures, barlines (that divide measures), etc. Exact spacing between
notes--for example, having a half note take up twice the space of a quarter note--is not extremely
important (and in fact can be ridiculous or impossible if a piece sometimes uses very long notes
and sometimes very short notes); but the general principle that longer notes get more space than
shorter notes is a good one that you should follow.</p>

<p>For instance, consider this piece made up of three different parts.  Click each of them to hear
it. (Each part is on one note, but I've written them on different notes so you can hear them separately):</p>

<div id='asPart1'></div>
<div id='asPart2'></div>
<div id='asPart3'></div>

<p>The parts don't look like they belong together because each of the parts is unaligned with the
others. When the parts are aligned, they look like they belong to the same piece. Click this to hear
what that sounds like:
</p>

<div id='asScore1'></div>

<p>When parts that are meant to be heard together are written together, not only are they aligned
but their left-most barline is drawn connected to each other. We often also put a bracket or fancy
curly brace between the different parts to show that they will be played together. (This is optional,
but the connecting barline is <b>not</b>!)</p>

<p>Most good software will automatically do this sort of alignment for you, but it is still a
very important skill to learn. <b>On staff paper, by hand</b>, neatly recopy the three parts below
so that they line up with each other. Pay close attention to making sure that all notes that play
together are perfectly aligned and that no measure has a lot of extra space or feels cramped.
</p>

<div id='asAssign1'></div>
<div id='asAssign2'></div>
<div id='asAssign3'></div>

<p>Reminder: do this in PENCIL and ERASE any mistakes thoroughly. Never, ever scratch out notes.</p>
